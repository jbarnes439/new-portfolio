            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I have a varied background prior to software engineering.</p>
            <p>Some of the positions I have held prior to software engineering include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Certified Veterinary Technician</li>
                <li>Emergency Room tech</li>
                <li>Even Pyrotechnician - setting up and shooting commercial fireworks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I am looking forward to applying my new found skillset into these and/or other industries that are lagging behind in the technical department.
            </p>
            <h3>How my passion for software engineering has <i>developed</i>.</h3>
            <p>
                I remember the first few times I saw pages of code. I was overwhelmed. A screen full of text that didn't make any sense to me. I mistakenly wrote off the idea that I could ever understand how to create a computer program. I am happy to say, 20 some odd
                years later, that simply isn't true. The knowledge of editing web pages, apps, or progams and the ability to create them is addictive. Creating this webpage alone is more fun and rewarding than I thought it ever could be. Applying style
                changes, adding new elements, committing the changes and quickly refreshing the webpage to see the changes take effect. I am eager to learn more of the tools and styling options available. As my skills develop and my knowledge grows, I
                am looking forward to working together with others on larger projects and seeing the culmination of multiple individual's work coming together.
            </p>
            <h4>The unlikely path to software engineering.</h4>
            <p>
                Live music events and music festivals were the unlikely heroes of my renewed interest in learning about software engineering. Through attending various concerts and music festivals I cultivated a large group of friends. Many of whom code for a living.
                Through discussions with these friends I was persuaded to purchase <i>Python Crash Course</i>. It was this purchase that started my exploration into the world of software engineering. After months of working through exercises
                in the text book I felt confident enough to begin looking for coding bootcamps. I stumbled upon the CareerKarma team and their app which pairs prospective students with bootcamps that fit their criteria. Through CareerKarma I was paired
                with Thinkful. Thinkful's great bootcamp prep-course with one-on-one mentoring included, has definitely helped cultivate this new passion.
